# CatswordsToken
CatswordsToken is the lawsuit protection plan for cybersecurity researchers.

## What is CatswordsToken?
Open Catswords (https://catswords.com) is a cybersecurity assistant service, found in 2008.

We are interested in the legal and economic problems that researchers are experiencing in tracking malware and cybercriminals.

We aim to respond quickly to these problems and support them.

## Why CatswordsToken?
CatswordsToken allows you to take advantage of the same or more robust networks that are equivalent to Darkcoin and special-purpose ETHs for malicious hackers and malware authors.

CatswordsToken gives you the power to defeat virtual currency and block-chain warfare against malicious hackers and malware authors. CatswordsToken's primary goal is to legally protect security analysts.

The private security analyst's monthly income is 10% compared to the one-time attorney's selection fee for civil cases. It is even difficult if you're trying to receive public legal support (free legal consultation and public attorney) because many ICT fields require special interpretation.

CatswordsToken protects security analyzers through a program that assesses and determines the value of security analyzersâ€™ actions. A researcher can convert all his research activities to CatswordsToken for any purpose. This is different from the Bug Bounty Program.

Unlike Bounty which requires only results, CatswordsToken supports the entire process of all research, writing, PoC, and R&D performed by security analyzers.

Until now, if you have been following major security companies, private and public organizations that support security economically, you did not have to do that now to get these activities into value.

Everyone who works on security as a job or hobby has the right to receive security protection by CatswordsToken.
