# CatswordsToken
CatswordsToken is the legal protection program for malware researchers.

## What is CatswordsToken?
Catswords Community (https://catswords.com) is malware researcher's assistant service. Founded in 2008.

We are interested in the legal and economic problems that researchers are experiencing in tracking malware and cybercriminals.

We aim to respond quickly to these problems and support them.

## Why CatswordsToken?
CatswordsToken allow you to take advantage of the same or more robust networks that are equivalent to Darkcoin and special-purpose ETHs for malicious hackers and malware authors.

CatswordsToken give you the power to defeat virtual currency and block-chain warfare against malicious hackers and malware authors.
CatswordsToken primary goal is to legally protect security analysts.

The private security analyst's monthly income is 3 ~ 20% compared to the one-time attorney's selection fee for civil cases.
It is even difficult if you're trying to receive a public legal support (free legal consultation and public attorney), because many ICT field requires special interpretation.

CatswordsToken protects security analyzers through a program that assesses and determines the value of security analyzersâ€™ actions. A researcher can convert all his research activities to Catswords Token for any purpose. This is different from the Bug Bounty Program.

Unlike Bounty which requires only results, CatswordsToken supports the entire process of all research, writing, PoC, and R&D performed by security analyzers.

Until now, if you have been following major security companies, private and public organizations that support security economically, you did not have to do that now to get these activities into value.

Everyone who works on security as a job or hobby has the right to receive security protection by CatswordsToken.
